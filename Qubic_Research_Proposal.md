## 🔍 What is this Proposal About?

This project delivers a dual-focus, in-depth research report for the Qubic ecosystem:

1. **Hashrate Strategy & PoW Risk Modeling**  
   - Analyzes how Qubic’s hashrate coordination on Monero created a new form of economic soft attack  
   - Explores which PoW chains (e.g., Dogecoin, Kaspa) could be next based on structural vulnerabilities

2. **Decentralized AI Architecture & AIGarth Improvements**  
   - Compares AIGarth to decentralized AI systems like Bittensor, Nous (Psyche), Prime Intellect  
   - Provides proposals for improving UPoW, training efficiency, and task markets in Qubic

## 🎯 Goals

- Defend Qubic’s public perception by clarifying the Monero mining strategy  
- Provide blueprints for improving AIGarth’s architecture and developer appeal  
- Identify potential structural risks or advantages in Qubic’s approach to PoW and AI  
- Support broader ecosystem dialogue about coordination, incentives, and decentralization

## 🧠 Scope of Work

### 1. PoW Hashrate Coordination Analysis
- Economic modeling of Qubic’s dominance in Monero mining
- Comparison to traditional 51% attacks and “soft attacks” via incentives
- Modeling future target chains (Dogecoin, Ergo, Ravencoin, etc.)
- ROI comparisons: Qubic token farming vs. raw Monero/PoW mining

### 2. Comparative Study of AI Architectures
- AIGarth’s UPoW system and evolution-based neural net design
- Comparison to:
  - Bittensor: dTAO subnets, alpha-token staking
  - Nous: DisTrO compression & gradient-efficient coordination
  - Prime Intellect: elastic mesh, quantized distributed learning
- Recommendations for optimizing AIGarth:  
  - Task-specific subnets  
  - External developer onboarding  
  - Efficient gradient sync (compressed, sparse, delayed updates)
